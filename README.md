# Portfolio-Website
I created a self-portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It showcases my professional experience, education, skills, and a portfolio of my work. The website is visually appealing, functional, and optimized for search engines. I included a contact form for visitors to get in touch with me. I am happy with the final result and believe it reflects my skills and experience.
